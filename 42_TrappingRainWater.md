# [Leetcode 42: Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/) [2-pointers] [Hard]

## Problem Statement:
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**

![Example1](static/rainwatertrap.png)

_Input_: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

_Output_: 6

_Explanation_: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 2:**

_Input_: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]

_Output_: 9

## âœ… Intuition:
We use a **two-pointer approach** to simulate how water gets trapped between walls of different heights.

## Solution
ðŸ§  **Core Idea:**
The amount of water trapped at any index depends on the shorter boundary on either side of it.

Mathematically:

```waterAt[i] = min(maxLeft, maxRight) - height[i]```

Instead of precomputing max values for every index (which takes extra space), use two pointers:
* left starting at index 0
* right starting at the end

Track the highest wall seen so far on both sides: `maxLeft` and `maxRight`.

At each step:
1. Move the pointer that has the lower max height so far.
2. Calculate trapped water at the new position using that sideâ€™s max.
3. This works because water canâ€™t rise above the shorter boundary.

This results in a single pass with constant space.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Observations:
1. **Water is limited by the shorter wall:**
    Always move the pointer with the smaller max height.
    Hence the condition: if (maxLeft < maxRight).
2. **Always move the pointer first, then calculate:**
    This ensures the calculation is based on the new position, not the current one.
3. **Ignore the opposite side while calculating:**
    If maxLeft < maxRight, the trapped water is determined entirely by maxLeft.
    The right side doesnâ€™t affect the current calculation because water can only rise as high as the shorter boundary.

## ðŸ§© Mnemonic:
```**Move Short, Update Max, Measure Depth**```

1. Move Short side (based on maxLeft vs maxRight)
2. Update Max value at that pointer
3. Measure Depth as max - height[i] (only if max > height[i])

### Time Complexity:
**O(n)** - Each element in the height array is processed only once.

### Space Complexity:
**O(1)** - No additional arrays or data structures are used.

```java
public static int trap(int[] height) {
    int maxLeft = height[0];
    int maxRight = height[height.length - 1];
    int left = 0;
    int right = height.length;

    int totalTrappedWater = 0;
    int trappedWaterAtIdx;

    while(left < right) {
        if(maxLeft < maxRight) {
            left++;
            maxLeft = Math.max(maxLeft, height[left]);
            trappedWaterAtIdx = maxLeft - height[left];
            if(trappedWaterAtIdx > 0) {
                totalTrappedWater += trappedWaterAtIdx;
            }
        } else {
            right--;
            maxRight = Math.max(maxRight, height[right]);
            trappedWaterAtIdx = maxRight - height[right];
            if(trappedWaterAtIdx > 0) {
                totalTrappedWater += trappedWaterAtIdx;
            }
        }
    }

    return totalTrappedWater;
}
```
